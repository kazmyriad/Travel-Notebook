- has to work for different devices (Browser and mobile)
- Implementation does NOT have to be compelete for final presentation (we'll have a week after the final presentation to finish it up)
- We also need to create icons (I can draw them if you guys want!)

- I (Alyssa) will do all the merging so make sure you **fork** this and **commit changes**
